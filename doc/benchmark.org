* Meta
** What kind of services are we looking to benchmark wonko-client for?
- Low latency services like Furtive and Eccentrica, that get over 1000
  requests per second, where request probably monitors about 5
  metrics. Roughly a couple of streams, counters and gauges.

** What questions are we looking to answer?
- What will the latency impact be?
- What will the memory requirement/impact be for such a service?
- What will the CPU requirement/impact be?
- What will the Network i/o impact be?
- What is the process of tuning wonko-client for performance or
  resource optimization?
- What are the available knobs/configs to tune performance? Are they
  sufficient?
- How do we tune wonko-client's performance for daemon/collector like
  processes that send a bunch of metrics in brief spikes or batches?

** What environment and h/w should the benchmarks be run on?
Typically, a production like environment. 4G RAM, 4 cores sound like a
reasonable configuration to run on without spending too much. We'll
run a real kafka instance in a separate machine/vm to emulate
reality.
